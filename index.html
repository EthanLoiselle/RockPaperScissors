        // The function should take two parameters 1) the playerSelection and 2) computerSelection.
        // A string should be returned that displays something along the line of "You win!", "You Lose!" or "Draw!".
        // The playerSelection parameter should be case insensitive to ensure any variation of "Rock/rock/ROCK" is accepted.
        // If the result ends up being "Draw" Establish code so that both players will play again until a winner is decided.
        // Write another function called game(). Call the playRound function from within.
        // Establish a loop to ensure up to 5 rounds are played and score is being kept.
        // The score variables will be kept within the console and depending on the outcome will display "Victory" or "Game Over".
